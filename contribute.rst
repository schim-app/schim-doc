First of all, thank you for your interest in the app. Schim started out of the
frustration with the limitations that proprietary software imposes on its users.
So there you go: **in Schim you can customize literally anything**.

Overview
========

Schim is made up of multiple repositories:

`Schim <https://github.com/schim-app/schim>`_
   This is the main code repository. It contains everything that is necessary to
   compile and install Schim.
`Schim documentation <https://github.com/schim-app/schim-doc>`_
   This is where Schim's complete documentation resides. You are reading it
   right now!
`Schim extras <https://github.com/schim-app/schim-extra>`_
   This is the cherry on top of the cake. It contains anything that can be
   used to enhance the user experience, but which is not part of the
   application. This includes configuration files for shells, syntax for text
   editors and more sweet stuff.
`Schim assets <https://github.com/schim-app/schim-assets>`_
   All promotional and educational material lives here. This includes posters,
   videos, tutorials, etc.

If you decide to develop code for this project, the :ref:`Developer
Documentation` is a useful resource. It is written in great detail. It also makes
Schim a useful first project for beginners.
